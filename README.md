## Technologies
* React
* TypeScript
* Music libraries
    * Tone.js - synth and audio playback
    * Tonal.js - music theory utilities

## Features
* A random note generator which displays a random note and plays it back. 
    * New notes can be generated with the press of a button.
* An interval explorer which plays and displays a random example of any chosen interval ('random' is also an option). 
    * The notes forming the interval can be played individually via buttons. 
    * Pressing on one of the interval buttons will generate a new example of that kind of interval.
    
## Future Features
* A chord player which will work similarly to the interval player but will include different chord qualities instead.
* An interactive quiz to recognize different types of intervals and chord qualities.
* An interactive quiz to sing different types of intervals and chord qualities. It would rely on user self-evaluation and not voice recognition, so that the user can practice in situations where they cannot make much sound.
